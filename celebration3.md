We invite you  to share in the joy of reaching 3,000,000 reviews.

For this milestone we organize an event where you, dutiful reviewers, get to share your best comics, Haiku's, comments.

The content you share should somehow relate to Q/A, moderation, clean-up, garbage collection, reaching a goal ... 

One-boxes during this event are encouraged and allowed. 

The event takes place at December 19th, 17:00 UTC and lasts 60 minutes. After that normal room operation hopefully resumes...
