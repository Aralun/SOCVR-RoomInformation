* [rene](http://stackoverflow.com/users/578411/rene)
* [gunr2171](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1043380/gunr2171)
* [durron](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1768232/durron597)

[Andrew Cheong](http://stackoverflow.com/users/925913/andrew-cheong) is the original room owner and creator of the room. [Dukeling](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1711796/dukeling) is also a room owner. Both stop by every once and awhile.

## Let's recap the goals of the CV Chat Room

## Why do we need room owners?

## What sort of behavior should Room Owners enforce?
The CV chat room has quite a bit of power. In the extreme cases we can insta-close any question, and this gives us moderator-like powers with very little external review.

We love this community. Our goal is to get rid of the "crap" so the good content can be easier found. (add more...)

(and now some bullet points, can be expanded to paragraphs if needed)

* [cv-pls] should not be a habbit for users. Don't make it a habbit to fast-track a particular post to the front of the closure system. Exceptions are if the post is _really_ bad or that tag's users can't close in time. (this bullet point should have it's own section)
* Please keep the number of pinned items in the starboard to a minimum. It's ok to update and replace an existing if the information is still relivent.
* Try to keep messages with tags out of the starboard unless they are tags to work on, they will confuse people.
