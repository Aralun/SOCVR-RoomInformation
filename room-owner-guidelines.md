# Guidelines for the Room Owners in the SO CV Chat Room

## Who are the room owners?
The room owners are

* [rene](http://stackoverflow.com/users/578411/rene)
* [gunr2171](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1043380/gunr2171)
* [durron](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1768232/durron597)

[Andrew Cheong](http://stackoverflow.com/users/925913/andrew-cheong) is the original room owner and creator of the room. [Dukeling](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1711796/dukeling) is also a room owner. Both stop by every once and awhile.

## Let's recap the goals of the CV Chat Room

The room originated as a meeting place once a week to handle your 40 allotted review tasks. The feeling to make a dent with a couple of fellow users worked as an incentive. The motivation to make a difference is still there. 

The moderation efforts of the room broaden, still aiming to reduce the close vote queue. However the room now acts pro-actively by issuing [cv-pls] requests, reopen voting, tag cleanup, burnination efforts, editing, coaching/commenting, delete voting, and feeding the [roomba][1].

To be an effective member of this room you'll need access to the review queues and you _better_ have some experience on Stack Overflow. Ideally 3k reputation, but 1k will do. That assumes you know the core of the site and assumes you have enough experience in (self)moderation.  

## Why do we need room owners?

We really shouldn't need room owners, but because we do we need to establish some guidelines.

The RO basically are there to slow down the enthusiastic crowd and to make sure we focus on posts and their quality and not on users.

The CV chat room has quite a bit of power. In the extreme cases we can insta-close any question, and this gives us moderator-like powers with very little external oversight.

We lead by example to prevent the room to become the mob.

## What sort of behaviour is expected?

We love this community. Our goal is to get rid of the "crap" so the good content can be easier found. As Room Owners we are sensitive for the needs of the community on Stack Overflow and encourage our members to help us create a guidance toolkit that enables all of us to fulfil those needs.

**No matter what is asked from us, we moderate the post and educate the user, the [be nice policy][2] is our bible.** 

Make sure you are ok with exerting your power, but understand when it is necessary to do so to keep the peace.

We are open for any critic, feedback and guidance received from the community as we are a part of it.

Room Owners step in the moment we notice site users are targeted by any room member. This goes without warning.

###General behaviour for Room Owners:
* Is a role model for the kind of participaton expected. 
* Makes the final call in any dispute, unless the RO team decide otherwise. 
* Clears messages that are starred with a tag from the starboard
* Keeps the number of pinned items in the starboard to a minimum. It's ok to update and replace an existing if the information is still relevant.
* Keep the tags that the room is working on in the description of the chat room. This way we don't need to use pinned messages.
* Start the meeting.
* Schedule the events.

###General expectations for Members:
* [cv-pls] should not be a habit for users. Don't make it an instinct to fast-track a particular post to the front of the closure system. Exceptions are made if the post is _really_ bad or the users in that tag can't close the post in time.
* [cv-pls] mean "close vote _please_", not "close vote or I'll stab you". There should be no expectation for other members to close vote any post you bring up, and do not pressure anyone into doing so.
* Extended discussion about a [cv-pls] is useless; we don't have to agree/consensus about a close request. We're not a democracy. However, users that are posting [cv-pls] that are blatantly wrong will be told so. The final verdict is on the RO team.
* All members are accountable for their actions when and if such accountability is requested on meta.
* Tag burniation requests and tag cleanup requests _must_ be backed by an MSO post with significant community support.
* A post is only actively edited/commented/handled by one member of the room. We don't need 4 members all leaving witty statements in the comments or in chat.
* All discussions are public. The RO team has an offline/private lounge for sensitive subjects if necessary.
* In absence of all Room Owners, the members lead-by-example.
