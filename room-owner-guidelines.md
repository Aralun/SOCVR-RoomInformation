* [gunr2171](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1043380/gunr2171)
* [durron](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1768232/durron597)

[Andrew Cheong](http://stackoverflow.com/users/925913/andrew-cheong) is the original room owner and creator of the room. [Dukeling](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1711796/dukeling) is also a room owner. Both stop by every once and awhile.

## Let's recap the goals of the CV Chat Room

The room originated as a meeting place once a week to handle your 40 allotted review task. The feeling to make a dent with a couple of fellow users would work as an incentive. The incentive and making dents is still there. The moderation efforts of the room broadend, still aiming to reduce the close vote queue. However the room now acts pro-active, by issue-ing cv-pls requests, re-open voting, tag clean-up and burnination efforts, editing, coaching/commenting, as well as roomba-ing and delete voting.

## Why do we need room owners?

We really shouldn't need room owners, and with that this guideline.   
To be an effective member of this room you'll need access to the review-queues and you better have some experience on main. Ideally 3K, but 1K will do. That assumes you know the site and assumes you have enough experience in (self)moderation.  

The RO basically are there to slow down the enthousiastic crowd and to make sure we focus on posts and their quality and not on users.

We are the godfathers to prevent the room to become the mob.

## What sort of behavior should Room Owners enforce?
The CV chat room has quite a bit of power. In the extreme cases we can insta-close any question, and this gives us moderator-like powers with very little external review.

We love this community. Our goal is to get rid of the "crap" so the good content can be easier found. As room owners we are sensitive for the needs of the community on Stack Overflow and encourage our members to help us create a guidance toolkit that enables all of us to fulfil those needs.  

**No matter what is aked from us, we moderate the post and educate the user, the [be nice policy](http:/link) is our bible.** 

Room owners step in the moment we notice users are targetted by any roommember. This goes without warning.

* [cv-pls] should not be a habbit for users. Don't make it a habbit to fast-track a particular post to the front of the closure system. Exceptions are if the post is _really_ bad or that tag's users can't close in time. (this bullet point should have it's own section)
* cv-pls -> Close vote please, not Close vote or I stab you
* Extended discussion about cv-pls is useless, we don't have to agree/concensus about a cv-pls. We're not a democracy.
* However, users that are posting cv-pls that are blatantly wrong will be told so, the final verdict is on the RO team
* Any RO's descision is final, unless the RO team decide otherwise
* Tag burniation requests are backed by an MSO post
* Tag cleanup requests are backed by an MSO post
* All members are acountable for their actions when and if such accountability is requested on meta
* A post is only active edited/commented/handled by one members of the room (not 4 members all leaving witty statements)
* All discussions are public but the RO team has an offline/private lounge to reduce noise
* The tags the room focus on is in the room description
* Messages that are starred with a tag in it will be cleared from the starboard
* Please keep the number of pinned items in the starboard to a minimum. It's ok to update and replace an existing if the information is still relivent.
* Try to keep messages with tags out of the starboard unless they are tags to work on, they will confuse people.
