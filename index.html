<p>Let's face it. The Close Vote Queue on Stack Overflow is huge. It's a dauntingly large number. At one point, it was over 100k. It's a much tamer amount now, but it can feel like your contributions don't amount to anything.</p>

<p>We feel your pain. We want to help. Together, we can make a dent.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers">SO Close Vote Review Chat Room</a> is a group of like-minded people who want to make a difference in the CVQ. We concentrate our efforts on a single tag at a time, and it works. We ensure that more reviews <em>matter</em>, and more reviews get completed.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h2>

<p>There are no obligations. We can't force you to do anything, and we don't want to either. The first purpose of the chat room is to have company as you go through the queue. Having a group beside you as you take on the queue really helps morals. We are also here to help with questions about what to do. Not sure what to do with a review item? Post a link and we will take a look at it!</p>

<p>We are also trying out a new tactic for the queue's filtering. By having all members concentrate on a single tag at a time we have a higher chance of completing the review tasks that we process. Whoever is leading the event of the day (usually Rene) will give the tag suggestion based off a <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/236526/tags-that-can-be-cleared-of-votes">SEDE query</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-can-i-join-in" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-join-in" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I join in?</h2>

<p>First, check out the <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers">chat room's schedule of events</a>. It's updated by the room owners and shows the weekly meetups. There are two time periods to choose from (you can choose both if you are able to) so that people in all timezones can join.</p>

<p>If you can't wait until a weekly event, or want to help out more often, we do a smaller review session each day. Hop into chat between 17:00 and 22:00 UTC and help us fight the queue.</p>

<p>Members of chat have made some user scripts to help make your life easier (or just more enjoyable).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/kappa7194/stackoverflow-close-votes-shortcuts">Shortcut keys</a> - A script that allows a user to use the number keys to click review buttons, speeding up review time.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/UserScripts/blob/master/ChatRoomConfetti.js">Confetti chat messages</a> - Makes confetti appear on the screen when a type of message is said in chat (alpha status)</li>

</ul>

<p>(these will be updated with links shortly)</p>
